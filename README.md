# Bl√∂cks by Kosmos School

Bl√∂cks is a VR puzzle game made for the Oculus Quest. Build electrical circuits with different Blocks to master increasingly difficult challenges. This is a free early alpha release and the game is not in active development.

## üçï Challenges
Each Challenge has objectives that require you to measure a certain current (Ampere) or voltage (Volts). To successfully complete a challenge, you need to build a circuit with the available Blocks and make sure it has the right current and voltage.


## üéâ Installation
Bl√∂cks is only compatible with the Oculus Quest. You can download the apk from [Itch](https://kosmosschool.itch.io/blocks) and install ("sideload") it on your Quest via [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/) or manually. You can also clone this project and build it yourself in Godot.
