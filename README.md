# Bl√∂cks by Kosmos School

Bl√∂cks is a VR puzzle game made for the Oculus Quest. Build electrical circuits with different Blocks to master increasingly difficult challenges. This is a free early alpha release.

##üçï Challenges
Each Challenge has objectives that require you to measure a certain current (Ampere) or voltage (Volts). To successfully complete a challenge, you need to build a circuit with the available Blocks and make sure it has the right current and voltage.


##üë©‚Äçüíª Alpha Version
Bl√∂cks is in early and active development, and this is an alpha version. It currently contains 3 Challenges and 6 Blocks (batteries, lamps, a switch and a wire). We're shipping updates multiple times each month, and the full release is planned for summer. Please don't hesitate reaching out to us with feedback or any bugs you might encounter.


##üéâ Installation
Bl√∂cks is only compatible with the Oculus Quest. You can download the apk from [Itch](https://kosmosschool.itch.io/blocks) and install ("sideload") it on your Quest via [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/) or manually. You can also clone this project and build it yourself in Godot.
